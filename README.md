To change the maximum number that the number generator can reach, therefore the limit number, simply change this number in the script by replacing it with the maximum number you want:

<h2>⚠️ Caution ⚠️</h2>
<h4>How come it wrote 10,000 and said it is 9999?</h4>
Simply because the number entered is taken as the maximum number and therefore is not taken into consideration, therefore it cannot come out among the numbers drawn, for this you must always write the max number you want to insert <strong>+1 so that the number you have selected</strong> can also come out, for example if I want the maximum to be 18 I will put 19 and so on
